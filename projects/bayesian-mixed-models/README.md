# Bayesian Mixed Models in R
This markdown file is meant to be an informative guide on building linear mixed models and generalized mixed models using Bayesian methods in R. This is part of a larger manual completed with another graduate student as part of the MS Statistics capstone project at Texas A&M University (summer 2022). My contribution is the Bayesian portion.

I will update this repo as the other parts of the manual are added, and will maintain the Bayesian section bit by bit over time.
