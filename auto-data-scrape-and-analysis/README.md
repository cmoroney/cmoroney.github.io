# Auto Data Scrape & Analysis
This project was created entirely from curiosity - I am a car hobbyist and spend a lot of time researching automotive 
engineering and have wanted to get my hands on a dataset that has specs for as many cars as possible to perform analysis on.

While I wasn't able to find a public API for this data, I did find a website that has all of the data available to the 
public for free. I scraped this website using BeautifulSoup4, the resulting dataset containing 60+ data points for 42,000
models from 66 makes.

First I'll explain the dataset a bit and perform some exploratory data analysis and then I will fit a model explaaining 0-60mph
times as a function of horsepower-to-weight ratio.
